###About me
I am a undergraduate student, major in software engineering, and plan to apply for graduate in
computer science area.   
Some fancy, and elegant techniques and principles intrigue me, especially those supporting computer's work.  
My interested areas are compiler, programming language, operating system, although currently not proficient.

###About website

Thanks for Jekyll and github, making building process so easy, leaving alone trivial Web Coding!  
As it was just build recently, some details may not seem perfect :-(
